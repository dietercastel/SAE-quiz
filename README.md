# SAE-quiz
This is a very basic example application to demonstrate the usage of the [Sec-Angular-Express (SAE)](https://github.com/dietercastel/SAE) security library. To get it working you need Node.Js (v0.10.26+), Apache CouchDB (v1.6.1+) and of course the SAE library. Don't forget to (re)configure the port numbers etc. to your needs.

If you set installed and set up everything correctly `npm install` in the project directory and `npm run sae` should start the application on localhost.
